# Prediction-Tool-for-Price-and-Volume-of-Stock
IMPLEMENTED A PYTHON APPLICATION TO PREDICT THE PRICE AND VOLUME OF STOCK.

Designed a Python application of Neural Network with Two Nodes(Price, Volume) to predict the Price and Volume of Stock. Provided GUI for the user to set different parameters including Sample Size, Batch Size, Number of Delayed Elements, Number of Iteration, Learning Rate. The Neural Network reads the historical data which provides price and volume and predicts the Price and Volume of Stock by using WidrowHuff learning, adaptive filters, and LMS algorithm. The application also plots the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and maximum absolute error for price and volume after each Batch Size on the same graph.

#### Concepts: Neural Network, WidrowHuff learning, Adaptive Filters, LMS algorithm
#### Tools: Matplotlib, NumPy, Tkinter 
#### Language: Python
